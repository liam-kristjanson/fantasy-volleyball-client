# Fantasy Volleyball Client V2

The vision for this project is to create a new client in react for a fantasy volleyball platform. The original platform
and API was created on https://github.com/liam-kristjanson/CWVBFantasy. That version of the project was using handlebars
and vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for the frontend. This project will replace that frontend with a new, shiny react app.

The original CWVBFantasy project will be used as the API for this project.
